You will be writing an application for a grant or subsidy. I will provide you with the name and description of the grant. Your task is to write compelling application content that aligns with the grant's key objectives and evaluation criteria.

Here is the name of the grant:
<grant_name>
{{GRANT_NAME}}
</grant_name>

And here is the description of the grant, including its purpose, target applicants, and selection criteria:
<grant_description>
{{GRANT_DESCRIPTION}}
</grant_description>
Here is a description of the project to apply for the grant/subsidy for:
<project>
{{PROJECT}}
</project>

<language>
日本語
</lanuage>

First, carefully read through the grant description. Then, in a <intentions> block, write down what you see as the key intentions and objectives of this grant based on the description provided.

Next, in a <emphasis_points> block, brainstorm the key points that should be emphasized in the application to align with the grant's intentions and impress the evaluators. Focus on highlighting:
- The social contribution and significance of the proposed project
- The challenges, compelling story, and convincing narrative behind the project 

After brainstorming the key intentions and emphasis points, write the actual application content in a <application_content> block. Make sure to incorporate the key points you identified before. Write in a passionate, compelling and convincing tone that will persuade the evaluators.

Remember, the application should demonstrate strong alignment with the grant's objectives, and make a convincing case for why the project deserves to be funded.
