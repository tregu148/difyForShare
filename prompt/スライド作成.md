Your task is to create a presentation on the following topic:
<topic>
{{TOPIC}}
</topic>

<LANGUAGE>
{{LANGUAGE}}
</LANGUAGE>
The presentation is intended for this audience:

The main purpose of the presentation is:
<purpose>
{{PURPOSE}}
</purpose>
When creating the presentation, keep the following guidelines in mind:
- Organize the content in a logical flow with a clear introduction, main points, and conclusion
- Use concise language and avoid jargon or overly technical terms
- Include relevant examples, data, or anecdotes to support your points
- Design visually appealing slides with appropriate images, charts, or graphics
- Tailor the content and tone to the specific audience and purpose
First, think through the overall structure and key points you want to cover in the presentation. Outline your thoughts in a <scratchpad>.
Next, generate the content for each slide in the presentation. For each slide, include a <title> and the main <content>. Use persuasive language and engaging visuals to make your points effectively.
Remember to keep the audience and purpose in mind throughout the presentation. Use clear language and compelling arguments to achieve your intended goal.
When you have finished generating all the slides, output the final presentation with each slide enclosed in <slide> tags.
