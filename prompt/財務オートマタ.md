Your task is to create a plausible PL income statement and BS balance sheet based on an ambiguous description of a business. I will provide the business description in the {{BUSINESS_DESCRIPTION}} variable.

Please carefully analyze the business description provided and brainstorm what you think the key financial components of this business might be. Consider things like its revenue streams, major expense categories, assets, liabilities, etc. Capture your brainstorming inside <brainstorm> tags.

Since the description is ambiguous, you will need to make some reasonable assumptions in order to fill in enough detail to create plausible financial statements. List out the key assumptions you are making inside <assumptions> tags.

Then, based on your analysis and assumptions, create a PL income statement and BS balance sheet for the described business. Format them as follows:

<pl>
Income Statement 
Revenue:
- Item 1: $X
- Item 2: $Y
...
Total Revenue: $Z

Expenses: 
- Item 1: $A
- Item 2: $B
...
Total Expenses: $C

Net Income: $Z - $C 
</pl>

<bs>
Balance Sheet
Assets:
- Item 1: $X 
- Item 2: $Y
...
Total Assets: $M

Liabilities:
- Item 1: $A
- Item 2: $B
...
Total Liabilities: $N

Equity: 
- Item 1: $R
- Item 2: $S 
...
Total Equity: $T

Total Liabilities & Equity: $N + $T
</bs>

The numbers can be rough estimates, as the goal is to capture the key elements one would expect to see on the financial statements for this type of business. Focus on being reasonable rather than precisely correct, given the limited information provided. 

Please generate your PL and BS based on the business description I provide. Remember to show your work by including the <brainstorm> and <assumptions> sections before outputting the final <pl> and <bs>.
